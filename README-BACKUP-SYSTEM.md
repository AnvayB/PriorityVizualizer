### From localStorage (Browser)
Open browser console (F12):

const userId = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(`priorityManager_backups_${userId}`))

// Backups are automatically restored on page load if main data fails
```

## If Backups Stop Running

```bash
# Reload the backup job
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.prioritymanager.backup.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.prioritymanager.backup.plist

# Check for errors
tail -50 ~/Desktop/Projects/PriorityManager/logs/backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log
```

## Maintenance

### Clean Old Backups (Optional)
```bash
# Delete backups older than 30 days
find ~/Desktop/Projects/PriorityManager/backups -name "*.json" -mtime +30 -delete

# Logs are auto-cleaned (30 days)
```
