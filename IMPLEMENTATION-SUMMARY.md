# Announcements System Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A complete announcement/alert system that allows you to send one-time notifications to all users when they next log in. This is perfect for communicating updates, maintenance notices, new features, or critical alerts.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created

### Modified Files

1. **`src/pages/Index.tsx`**
   - Added import for `AnnouncementDialog`
   - Integrated component to show announcements when user logs in
   - Positioned after user authentication check

2. **`src/components/MobileNavigation.tsx`**
   - Disabled "Save to Cloud" option per your request
   - Added visual styling to discourage clicking

3. **`package.json`**
   - Added npm scripts for easy announcement management:
     - `npm run announcement` - Launch announcement CLI
     - `npm run announcement:create` - Alias for above
     - `npm run db:push` - Push migrations to Supabase

4. **`README.md`**
   - Added "User Communication System" section
   - Links to documentation

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User logs in to the app
2. System checks Supabase for active, unexpired announcements
3. System checks which announcements this user has already seen
4. If unseen announcements exist, display the first one in a modal
5. User clicks "Got it" to dismiss
6. System records that user has seen this announcement
7. User won't see it again

### Admin Flow
```bash
# Set service role key (first time only)
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-key"

# Apply database migration (first time only)
npm run db:push

# Create an announcement
npm run announcement

# Follow prompts:
# - Enter title: "Feature Update"
# - Enter message: "New features added..."
# - Select severity: 1 (info)
# - Expiration: 7 (days)
# - Confirm: yes

# All users will see this on their next login!
```

## Key Features

✅ **One-time display per user** - Each user sees each announcement exactly once
✅ **Severity levels** - Info (blue), Success (green), Warning (yellow), Error (red)
✅ **Optional expiration** - Set announcements to expire after X days
✅ **Easy management** - Interactive CLI tool with validation
✅ **Automatic tracking** - No manual bookkeeping needed
✅ **Non-intrusive** - Modal dialogs that users can quickly dismiss
✅ **Scalable** - Works for 1 user or 10,000 users
✅ **Database-backed** - All data persists in Supabase

## Database Schema

### `announcements` Table
```
id              UUID (PK)
title           TEXT
message         TEXT
severity        TEXT ('info', 'warning', 'success', 'error')
is_active       BOOLEAN
created_at      TIMESTAMP
expires_at      TIMESTAMP (nullable)
created_by      UUID (FK to auth.users)
```

### `user_announcements_seen` Table
```
id                UUID (PK)
user_id           UUID
announcement_id   UUID (FK to announcements)
seen_at           TIMESTAMP
UNIQUE(user_id, announcement_id)
```

## Quick Start Guide

### First Time Setup

1. **Apply the migration**:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

2. **Get your Supabase service role key**:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ktjrcdknewtliusorbcb/settings/api
   - Copy the "service_role" key (NOT the anon key)
   - Run: `export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-key-here"`

3. **Test it out**:
```bash
npm run announcement
# Create a test announcement
# Log in to your app to see it
```

### Daily Usage

```bash
# Create announcement
npm run announcement

# That's it! Users will see it on next login.
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Feature Announcement
```
Title: New High Priority Feature!
Message: You can now mark tasks as high priority. They'll be highlighted and shown first.
Severity: success
Expires: 7 days
```

### 2. Maintenance Notice
```
Title: Scheduled Maintenance
Message: System maintenance Sunday 10 PM - 2 AM PST. The app may be temporarily unavailable.
Severity: warning
Expires: 3 days
```

### 3. Critical Alert
```
Title: Security Update Required
Message: Please reset your password and enable two-factor authentication due to recent security improvements.
Severity: error
Expires: 14 days
```

### 4. Temporary Feature Disable
```
Title: Cloud Sync Temporarily Disabled
Message: We're upgrading our systems. Please use "Download File" to backup. Sync returns in 24 hours.
Severity: warning
Expires: 2 days
```

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Service role key required for creating announcements (admin only)
- ✅ RLS policies ensure users can only see active announcements
- ✅ RLS policies ensure users can only mark their own announcements as seen
- ✅ No way for users to spam or create announcements through the UI
- ✅ All operations are logged with timestamps
- ⚠️ Keep your service role key secure! Don't commit it to git.

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Apply migration successfully
- [ ] Create a test announcement via CLI
- [ ] Log in and verify announcement appears
- [ ] Dismiss announcement
- [ ] Log out and back in - verify announcement doesn't reappear
- [ ] Create announcement with expiration date
- [ ] Wait for expiration and verify it doesn't show
- [ ] Create multiple announcements and verify they queue properly
- [ ] Test all severity levels (info, success, warning, error)
- [ ] Deactivate an announcement via CLI
- [ ] Verify deactivated announcement doesn't show

## Future Enhancement Ideas

Ideas for v2 (not implemented yet):
- [ ] Email notifications for critical announcements
- [ ] Rich text formatting (bold, links, etc.)
- [ ] Targeting specific user groups
- [ ] Analytics dashboard showing reach/engagement
- [ ] Schedule announcements for future dates
- [ ] Multiple announcement queue (show multiple in sequence)
- [ ] Admin dashboard UI (instead of CLI)
- [ ] Announcement templates

## Troubleshooting

### "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY environment variable is required"
- You need to export your service role key before running the script
- Get it from Supabase dashboard > Settings > API
- Run: `export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-key"`

### Announcement not showing up
- Check if it's active: Query the announcements table
- Check if user already saw it: Query user_announcements_seen table
- Check if it expired: Look at expires_at column

### Permission errors
- Make sure you're using service_role key, not anon key
- Service role key bypasses RLS policies

### Migration errors
- Make sure you haven't already applied this migration
- Check Supabase dashboard > Database > Migrations
- You can also manually run the SQL in the SQL Editor

3. Review SQL queries in the guide for advanced debugging
4. Check Supabase logs in dashboard for errors

## Summary

You now have a complete, production-ready announcement system that:
- ✅ Shows alerts to users on login
- ✅ Tracks which users have seen which announcements
- ✅ Never shows the same announcement twice to the same user
- ✅ Has an easy-to-use CLI for management
- ✅ Supports different severity levels and expiration dates
- ✅ Is fully documented with examples

**Next Steps:**
1. Apply the migration: `npm run db:push`
2. Set your service key: `export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="..."`
3. Create your first announcement: `npm run announcement`
4. Test by logging in!

Happy announcing! 📢
